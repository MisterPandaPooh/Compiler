## Exercise 0

Learn to read/write from/in a file. 
Use the functionnality of the FileManager.default. 
Develop a class for read and write in a file in a simply way.

### Basic syntax

**Let and var**. 
Use `let` for declaring constants.
```
let x: Int = 3
```
Use `var` for declaring variables.
```
var x: Int = 3
x = 4
```

Here the code for a simple function (main): 
```
func main() -> Int {
  print("hello world");
  return 1;
}
```
