# Basics of the Swift programming language

For a plain documentation, visit https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/. 

## Types
```Int``` for integers.  
```Double```and ```Float```for floating point values.   
```Bool```for boolean values.    
```String```for textual values.  

There are also the 3 primary **collection type**: ```Array```, ```Set``` and ```Dictionnary```.  

Swift also introduces the __optional type__. Optionals say either “there is a value, and it equals x” or “there isn’t a value at all”.  
We use those values in this way: ```String?```(for optionnal String).  

## Constants and variables

Use `let` to declare constants:  
```
let x: Int = 0; //  So the value of x will never change during the execution of the current scope
```
Use `var` to declare variables:
```
var x: Int = 0: // So the value of x could change during the execution of the current scope
